This Quickstart will guide you through setting up your Vast.ai account and running your first instance in just a few steps.

### 1\. Sign Up & Add Credit

### 2**. Prepare to Connect**

*   **For SSH access**: generate an [SSH key pair](https://docs.vast.ai/instances/sshscp) and upload your **public key** in [Keys page](https://cloud.vast.ai/manage-keys/). ![Keys](https://mintcdn.com/vastai-80aa3a82/KWV1TCiq0zjC57hU/images/guides-overview-quick-start-3.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=KWV1TCiq0zjC57hU&q=85&s=5b7bd06c9d287c89754a598a2be3c360)
*   **For Jupyter access**: download and install the provided [TSL certificate](https://docs.vast.ai/instances/jupyter#1SmCz) (needed for secure browser access).

### 3**. Pick a** [**Template**](https://docs.vast.ai/templates) **& Find a Machine**

*   Browse [**Templates**](https://cloud.vast.ai/templates/) for pre-built setups (e.g., [PyTorch](https://docs.vast.ai/pytorch), TensorFlow, ComfyUI).
*   Go to [**Search**](https://cloud.vast.ai/create/) and filter by GPU type, count, RAM, CPU, network speed, and price.
*   **Disk Space is Permanent.** The disk size you choose when creating an instance cannot be changed later. If you run out of space, you’ll need to create a new instance with a larger disk. Tip: Allocate a bit more than you think you need to avoid interruptions.
*   Click **Rent** when you find a match.
*   Wait for the instance to start—cached images launch quickly, fresh pulls may take 10–60 minutes.
*   Click **Open** button to access your instance.

### **4\.** [**Manage or End Your Instance**](https://docs.vast.ai/instances-guide)

*   Use **Stop** to pause GPU billing (storage still accrues charges).
*   Use **Delete** when finished to stop _all_ charges.

## Common Questions

### What is a minimum deposit amount?

The minimum deposit amount on Vast.ai is $5.

### What happens when my balance runs out? Can I avoid interruptions?

When your balance reaches zero, your running instances will automatically stop. To avoid this, you can enable **auto-billing** on the Billing page. Set an auto-charge threshold higher than your average daily spend, so your card is automatically charged when your balance falls below that amount. We also recommend setting a **low-balance email alert** at a slightly lower threshold to notify you if the auto-charge fails for any reason.

### How can I customize a template?

You can create a new template from scratch, or you can edit an existing template. You can find a guide [here](https://docs.vast.ai/templates#LrOME).
