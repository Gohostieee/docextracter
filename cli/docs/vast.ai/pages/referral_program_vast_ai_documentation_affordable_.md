# Referral Program - Vast.ai Documentation – Affordable GPU Cloud Marketplace

**URL:** https://docs.vast.ai/referral-program

---

Turn your audience into earnings! Share your unique Vast.ai referral link (or a public template link), and when someone creates a **new client account** and buys credits, you get **3%** of everything they spend — for the **lifetime** of their account. Better yet, you can cash out **75% of those referral credits** via **Stripe Connect, PayPal, or Wise**.

## How It Works

1.  **Share Your Link** – Post it on your site, in videos, blogs, or wherever your audience is.
2.  **They Join & Buy Credits** – New users sign up through your link and purchase credits.
3.  **You Earn** – Get 3% of their lifetime spend as referral credits.
4.  **Cash Out or Spend** – Use credits on Vast, or withdraw up to 75% as cash.

## Payout Rules — Important!

To **receive cash payouts** (outside of Vast), you **must** use a **dedicated referral account**:

*   If you’ve **ever rented instances or hosted machines** on an account, you **cannot** cash out until your referral earnings exceed your lifetime instance spend.
*   If you just want credits to rent Vast instances, you can use your main account.

**Why a separate account?**  
It keeps your referral earnings clear and makes sure you’re payout-eligible.

## Getting Your Referral Link

1.  Create a new account for referrals.
2.  Go to [**Settings**](https://cloud.vast.ai/account/) → **Referral Link**.

3.  Copy the link.
4.  Share it!

## Using Templates for Referrals

Want to make referrals even easier? Use [**Templates page**](https://cloud.vast.ai/templates/) to create your template. A template can pre-load:

*   A Docker image
*   Launch mode(s)
*   Onstart script
*   Environment variables

**Example:** The Stable Diffusion template loads the image, sets up Automatic1111 WebUI, starts Jupyter, and preps the environment — ready to go. Create [your own template](https://docs.vast.ai/creating-a-custom-template) for a use case, set it to **public**, then share its **template referral link.** The link will have this format:

Your audience clicks → Vast loads with your settings → they sign up → you earn. **Where to use it:** GitHub repos, videos, blog posts — anywhere your audience needs a “click and run” setup.

## Common Questions

### Where can I find referral link for my template?

Open your **Templates** page -> My Templates. On each template card, click the **three-dot menu** and select **Copy Referral Link**. This gives you a ready-to-share link that includes your referral ID and the template ID — perfect for sharing with your audience.
