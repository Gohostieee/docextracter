This page allows to view and manage team members and their roles. More on that [here](https://docs.vast.ai/teams-roles). To create a team, follow this [guide](https://docs.vast.ai/teams-quickstart).

## Page Walkthrough

Here’s an example of what a Members page would look like in the console. ![Members Page](https://mintcdn.com/vastai-80aa3a82/xCLov_y0JNSp_qUD/images/console-members.webp?fit=max&auto=format&n=xCLov_y0JNSp_qUD&q=85&s=edeb6ce87327da1cedb9d4ef60b575d3) You can change a role by clicking on directional arrow and selecting a new role.

You can also remove a teammate by clicking on ‘Delete’, which will trigger a pop-up.

As you can see from the images, this Members console page easily allows you to view and manage the current state of your team.
