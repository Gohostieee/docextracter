### Is there a spend rate limit on my account?

There is a spend rate limit for new users. Make sure you have verified your email; otherwise, your limit is near zero. Once you have verified your email, your spend rate limit increases automatically over time. If you are an enterprise user, email us at [contact@vast.ai](mailto:contact@vast.ai) to request a larger rate limit increase. Users paying with crypto are also eligible for rate increases.
