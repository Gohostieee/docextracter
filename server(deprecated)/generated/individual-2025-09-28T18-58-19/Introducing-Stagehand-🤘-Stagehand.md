## AI Summary

### Summary of "Introducing Stagehand"

Stagehand is a modern browser automation framework designed to provide a reliable and maintainable way to control web browsers. The documentation introduces it as a solution to the common pitfalls of web automation, positioning it as a middle ground between traditional, brittle scripting tools like Playwright and unpredictable, fully autonomous AI web agents. The core value proposition of Stagehand is its hybrid approach, which combines the flexibility of AI and natural language with the precision and control of deterministic code. This allows developers to choose the exact level of AI intervention needed for their tasks, resulting in automations that are both robust and adaptable to UI changes.

The framework is built around four primary primitives, which are demonstrated in a clear code example for both TypeScript and Python:
*   **`Act`**: Executes actions described in natural language (e.g., `await page.act("click the login button");`).
*   **`Extract`**: Pulls structured data from a page based on a defined schema.
*   **`Observe`**: Discovers and lists available actions or elements on the current page.
*   **`Agent`**: Automates entire multi-step workflows autonomously based on a high-level goal.

This documentation is targeted at developers building production-level browser automations or AI agents that require dependable web access. Key technical features highlighted include full compatibility with the Playwright API, allowing developers to use familiar tools alongside Stagehand's abstractions. It offers first-class SDKs for TypeScript and Python and is compatible with all Chromium-based browsers. The page also notes that Stagehand is created by the team at Browser

# Introducing Stagehand

Copy page

Developers use Stagehand to reliably automate the web.

Copy page

Stagehand is a browser automation framework used to control web browsers with natural language and code. By combining the power of AI with the precision of code, Stagehand makes web automation flexible, maintainable, and actually reliable.

The Problem with Browser Automation

Traditional frameworks like Playwright and Puppeteer force you to write brittle scripts that break with every UI change. Web agents promise to solve this with AI, but leave you at the mercy of unpredictable behavior. **You‚Äôre stuck between two bad options:**

-   **Too brittle**: Traditional selectors break when websites change
-   **Too agentic**: AI agents are unpredictable and impossible to debug

##

[‚Äã

](#enter-stagehand)

Enter Stagehand

Stagehand gives you the best of both worlds through four powerful primitives that let you choose exactly how much AI to use:

[

## Act

Execute actions using natural language

](/basics/act)[

## Extract

Pull structured data with schemas

](/basics/extract)[

## Observe

Discover available actions on any page

](/basics/observe)[

## Agent

Automate entire workflows autonomously

](/basics/agent)

TypeScript

Python

Ask AI

```
// Act - Execute natural language actions
await page.act("click the login button");

// Extract - Pull structured data
const { price } = await page.extract({
  schema: z.object({ price: z.number() })
});

// Observe - Discover available actions
const actions = await page.observe("find submit buttons");

// Agent - Automate entire workflows
const agent = stagehand.agent({
    provider: "anthropic",
    model: "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
    options: {
      apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
    },
})
await agent.execute("apply for this job");
```

](#why-developers-choose-stagehand)

Why Developers Choose Stagehand

-   **Precise Control**: Mix AI-powered actions with deterministic code. You decide exactly how much AI to use.
-   **Actually Repeatable**: Save and replay actions exactly. No more ‚Äúit worked on my machine‚Äù with browser automations.
-   **Maintainable at Scale**: One script can automate multiple websites. When sites change, your automations adapt.
-   **Composable Tools**: Choose your level of automation with Act, Extract, Observe, and Agent.
