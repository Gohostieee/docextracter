## AI Summary

As a technical documentation expert, here is a summary and analysis of the provided "Page Not Found" page.

### Summary

This documentation page is a "Page Not Found" (404) error, indicating that the requested URL, `https://docs.stagehand.dev/evaluations/models`, does not correspond to an existing document. The primary purpose of this page is to inform the user of the broken link while providing helpful recovery options to prevent a dead end. Instead of a generic error, the page offers context-aware suggestions based on the user's likely intent, recommending links to "Evaluations & Metrics," "Models," and "Cost Optimization." This suggests the original page may have been moved, renamed, or that the user was attempting to find information on how different models perform in evaluations.

The page is designed for developers and technical users of the Stagehand framework who are navigating the documentation. While it contains no specific code examples or configuration details itself, it serves as a crucial navigational tool. It includes the complete documentation sidebar, which provides a high-level sitemap of the Stagehand product. This navigation reveals that Stagehand is a browser automation tool with features organized into categories like "First Steps," "The Basics" (covering core functions like `act`, `extract`, `observe`, and `agent`), "Configuration," and "Best Practices."

The most relevant related topics are explicitly linked on the page. Users looking for information on "evaluation models" are directed to the correct, separate pages for **Models** (`/configuration/models`) and **Evaluations** (`/configuration/evals`). This structure implies that model selection and performance evaluation are treated as distinct but related configuration topics within the Stagehand documentation. There are no prerequisites to understanding this page, as its function is purely informational
