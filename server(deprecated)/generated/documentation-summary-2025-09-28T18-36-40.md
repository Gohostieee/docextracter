### Summary of: Working with iframes - 🤘 Stagehand

This documentation page provides a practical guide for developers on how to use the Stagehand library to interact with web page elements located inside iframes. It begins by defining iframes as embedded pages used for components like consent banners, payment widgets, or chat bubbles, emphasizing that their content exists in a separate context from the main page. The core instruction is to enable iframe support by setting the `iframes: true` parameter within Stagehand's primary functions: `act()`, `observe()`, and `extract()`. This allows the Stagehand agent to search for and interact with elements inside any iframes present on the page.

The document includes a clear code example demonstrating the implementation for TypeScript and Python, showing how to apply the `iframes: true` flag to each of the three main functions. It also outlines several key best practices and tips for developers. To optimize performance, it is recommended to use this option only when necessary, as it can increase processing time. For debugging, developers can inspect Stagehand logs to confirm if an element is within an iframe. The guide also addresses potential reliability issues with lazy-loaded iframes, suggesting that adding small waits or re-

### **Summary of "Working with iframes - 🤘 Stagehand"**

This documentation page serves as a best practice guide for developers using the Stagehand web automation library to interact with elements located inside HTML iframes. The target audience is developers who are already familiar with Stagehand's basic commands but need to automate tasks on complex web pages that embed content, such as payment widgets, consent banners, or third-party chat bubbles. The document explains that elements within an iframe exist in a separate document context and therefore require a specific approach to be accessible by Stagehand's automation functions.

The core instruction of the guide is to enable iframe support by setting the `iframes: true` parameter in Stagehand's primary commands: `act()`, `observe()`, and `extract()`. A clear code example demonstrates this implementation for each function, showing how to click a button, find an element, or extract data from within an iframe. The page also provides crucial tips for effective use, advising that this feature should be used only when necessary, as it can increase processing time and impact performance. For troubleshooting, it recommends checking Stagehand logs to confirm the presence of iframes and suggests adding small waits or re-running actions to handle intermittently failing interactions, which may be caused by lazy-loaded iframes.

As a prerequisite, users should have a foundational understanding of Stagehand's `act()`, `observe()`, and `extract()` functions. The page concludes by linking to related topics for further reading, including the fundamentals of these core functions, as well as other best practices like caching actions and deploying Stagehand. It also briefly mentions that experimental features, such as Shadow DOM support, can be enabled through the main browser configuration, directing users to the relevant configuration guide.
